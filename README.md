In this script, I've created a Streamlit web application called "YouTube Video Summarizer ðŸŽ¥" using the Llama 2 model from the Haystack library. When you visit the app, you'll see a title and a brief description explaining its purpose. The app is designed to summarize YouTube videos while you watch.

To use the app, you simply enter a YouTube video URL into the input box provided and click the "Submit" button. Upon clicking, the app starts processing: it first downloads the video from the provided URL. Then, it initializes the Llama 2 model and transcribes the video's audio content. Using this transcription, the app generates a summary of the video's content.

During the processing, you'll be able to view the video in one column and the summarization result in another. The summarized text will be displayed, along with the time taken to process the video, giving you an idea of the app's efficiency.

Additionally, there's an expander section titled "About the App" that provides more information about the app's functionality.

This app aims to provide a convenient way to obtain summaries of YouTube videos, enhancing the user's experience by saving time and effort in understanding video content.
